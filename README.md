# Welcome to CS162 Final Project

Welcome to the Content Suggestion Team Project! You have two options to access this project: through Heroku and by manually downloading and running locally.

## Heroku Deployment

## Run Virtual Environment

Virtual environment is a key component in ensuring that the application is configured in the right environment

##### Requirements
* Python 3
* Pip 3

```bash
$ brew install python3
```

Pip3 is installed with Python3

##### Installation
To install virtualenv via pip run:
```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
```

##### Usage
Creation of virtualenv:

    $ virtualenv -p python3 venv

If the above code does not work, you could also do

    $ python3 -m venv venv

To activate the virtualenv:

    $ source venv/bin/activate

Or, if you are **using Windows** - [reference source:](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8921188/issue-with-virtualenv-cannot-activate)

    $ venv\Scripts\activate

To deactivate the virtualenv (after you finished working):

    $ deactivate

Install dependencies in virtual environment:

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Environment Variables

All environment variables are stored within the `.env` file and loaded with dotenv package.

**Never** commit your local settings to the Github repository!

## Run Application

Start the server by running:

    $ export FLASK_ENV=dev
    $ export FLASK_APP=web
    $ python3 -m flask run
    
If **using Windows**, use 'set' instead of 'export'

## Unit Tests
To run the unit tests use the following commands:

    $ python3 -m venv venv_unit
    $ source venv_unit/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements-unit.txt
    $ export FLASK_ENV=test
    $ export DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///web.db'
    $ export SECRET_KEY='testing_key'
    $ pytest unit_test

## Integration Tests

To run integration tests you need to start your containers and then run tests:

    $ python3 -m venv venv_integration
    $ source venv_integration/bin/activate
    $ pip3 install -r requirements-integration.txt
    $ export FLASK_ENV=test
    $ export DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://root:test_password@127.0.0.1:3306/main"
    $ docker-compose build --no-cache
    $ docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
    $ pytest integration_test
    $ docker-compose down

## Flask-Migrate

Flask-Migrations is an extensions that manages DB migrations, common commands:

flask db migrate (create migration)
flask db upgrade (implement migration in the DB)

## Sending Emails Template

The app can send emails using the following template:

```python
from .mail import mail

msg = Message(subject="email_subject", 
sender="no-reply@suggestme.com", 
recipients=[recipient_email@gmail.com])
msg.html = render_template("html_file_name_here.html")
mail.send(msg)
```

## Form Templates

Standardized form template that can be used in any view:

First import render_field, it's a template that will render form fields and show their respective errors in case there is any.

```{% from "_formhelpers.html" import render_field %}```

Then you can create forms by calling render_field(form_data, placeholder="test"):

```html
<form method=post>
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
    {{ render_field(form.data1, placeholder="Data 1") }}
    {{ render_field(form.data2, placeholder="Data 2") }}
    <p><input type=submit value="Submit">
</form>
```

There's also an optional extra line before submit, if you want to send 'flash' alerts to your form. 

```{% include "_messages.html" %}```

## Deployment
We will use Heroku as a tool to deploy your project, and it is FREE

We added Procfile to help you deploy your repo easier, 
but you may need to follow these steps to successfully deploy the project

1. You need to have admin permission to be able to add and deploy your repo to Heroku 
(Please ask your professor for permission)
2. You need to create a database for your website. 
We recommend you use [Heroku Postgres](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1)
3. You may need to add environment variables to deploy successfully - [Resource](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#using-the-heroku-dashboard)
